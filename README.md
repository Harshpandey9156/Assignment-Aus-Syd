# 🎉 Sydney Events Scraper Website

This project is a Node.js-based web application that automatically scrapes and displays live events happening in Sydney, Australia. The data is scraped from an open-source event listing site and displayed beautifully on a frontend webpage.

Users can browse upcoming events, and when they click "GET TICKETS", they're prompted for their email and redirected to the official event page.
